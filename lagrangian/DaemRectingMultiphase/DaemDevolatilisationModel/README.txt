All of the DAEM's do have a purpose. We can not just make a new devol model type becase the original base class DevolatilisationModel, does not have support for integrated rates. So I made a whole new base class and the corresponding additional models (Single, Constant) in addition to the one we really wanted DAEM. I added the DAEM to all models and file names right before the final Devolatilisation to distiguish the two groups (Daem vs original) of classes.
